          Michigan, a state located in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of
          the United States, was admitted to the Union on January 26, 1837,
          becoming the 26th state. Known as the "Great Lakes State" and
          "Wolverine State," Michigan boasts a diverse landscape of forests,
          lakes, and miles of coastline. Detroit, its largest city, is famous as
          the automotive capital of the world. Michigan is home to the Great
          Lakes, which include Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and
          Lake Erie.

          These vast bodies of water not only provide breathtaking scenery but
          also support a thriving fishing industry and offer numerous
          recreational activities like boating, swimming, and camping. The
          state's economy has historically been driven by manufacturing,
          particularly in the automobile industry. Detroit's nickname "Motor
          City" reflects its role as the birthplace of major automobile
          companies like Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.

          arts scene, numerous museums, and historical landmarks. The state is
          known for its love of sports, particularly football with the
          University of Michigan and Michigan State University football teams
          drawing passionate fans from across the state. With its natural
